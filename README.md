### Technicalities
A dark theme is selected to ease users' of any eye strain with a starry night gif background and responsive texts using rem units. Bootstrap is used for the navigation bar to make it responsive to screen size, turning to a burger menu when shrunk down.


Bootstrap is also used for the home page where all the development blogs are. Javascript is also used to allow the popup to appear 

Contact page is a contact form that allows users to send emails to mine, effectively contacting me.

About page allows viewers to read background information on me.

There are also logos on the right side of every page that links to the appropriate websites.
